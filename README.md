# BlogAPIPlatform
<p>Project Description:</p> <br>
<p>Developed a full-stack blogging platform with RESTful API backend and an EJS-based frontend. The platform allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented an Express.js server on Node.js to handle API requests on the backend (Port 4000).</li>
  <li>Built another Express server (Port 3000) to serve as the web application's backend, making API requests to the first server and serving dynamic EJS templates.</li>
  <li>Utilized Axios for server-to-server HTTP requests to fetch and manipulate blog posts data.</li>
  <li>Employed EJS templates to generate dynamic HTML content for displaying and editing blog posts.</li>
  <li>Managed state using an in-memory data store, capable of adding, updating, and deleting blog posts. </li>
  <li>Implemented graceful error-handling and basic data validation for more robust application behavior. </li>
</ul>
<p>Key Achievements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Successfully implemented a layered architecture separating the API logic from the application logic.</li>
  <li>Achieved a decoupled frontend and backend, making it easier to expand functionality in the future. </li>

</ul>
